# Amazon S3

- Amazon S3 allows us to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)

## S3 Buckets and Objects

- Buckets must have a globally unique name
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- Buckets do have a naming convention:
    - No uppercase
    - No underscore
    - 3-63 character long names
    - Name should not be an IP
    - Must start with a lower case letter or number
- Objects (files) have a key, which is the full path:
    - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
    - s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
- They key is composed of the **prefix** + *object name*:
    - s3://my-bucket/ **my_folder/another_folder/** *my_file.txt*
- There is no concept of directories within buckets, although the UI will trick us to think otherwise
- The keys can be very long names which contain slashes ("/")
- Object values are the content of the body
- Max object size is 5TB
- If uploading mor than 5 GB, we must use multi-part upload
- Each object in S3 can have metadata, tags and (optional) version ID

## S3 Versioning

- Versioning should be enabled at the bucket level
- Versioning means: objects uploaded with same key will increment the version
- It is best practice to version files in S3, because:
    - It will protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore version)
    - Provides the ability to rollback a file
- Notes:
    - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning, will have the version of **null**
    - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions of existing files

## S3 Encryption for Objects

- There are 4 methods of encrypting objects in S3:
    - SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled managed by AWS
    - SSE-KMS: leverages AWS KMS to manage encryption keys
    - SSE-C: keys are managed by the users
    - Client Side Encryption

### SSE-S3:

- Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS
- Objects are encrypted server side
- Uses AES-256 encryption
- In order to upload and set the SSE-S3 encryption, the upload request must have a header `"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"`

### SSE-KMS

- Encryption using keys handled and managed by KMS
- KMS advantages: user control + audit trail
- Objects are encrypted in the server side
- In order to upload and set the SSE-S3 encryption, the upload request must have a header `"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"`

### SSE-C

- Server-side encryption using the keys provided by the customers
- S3 does not store the encryption key the customers provide
- To upload the data, HTTPS must be used
- Encryption key must be provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request

### Client Side Encryption

- Files are encrypted by the customers before uploading them to S3
- Client side libraries can be used to accomplish this, example Amazon S3 Encryption Client
- Customers are responsible for encrypting the data as well
- Encryption keys are fully managed by the customers

## S3 Security

- User based security:
    - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- Resource based:
    - Bucket policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console, allows cross account
    - Object Access Control List
    - Bucket Access Control List
- An IAM principal can access an S3 object if:
    - the user IAM permissions allow it or the resource policy allows it
    - there is no explicit DENY

## S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based documents, which can contain:
    - Resources: buckets and objects
    - Actions: set of API to Allow or Deny
    - Effects: Allow or Deny
    - Principal: the account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
    - Grant public access to the bucket
    - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
    - Gran access to another account

## Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

- Block public access to buckets and objects granted through
    - *new* access control list (ACLs)
    - *any* access control list (ACLs)
    - new public bucket or access point policies
- Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public or access point policies
- These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
- ACL (Access Control List): define read and write permissions at the object level

## S3 Security - Other

- Networking: supports VPC Endpoints
- Logging and audit:
    - S3 Access Logs can be stored in other S3 buckets
    - API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
- Ser Security:
    - MFA Delete
    - Pre-Signed URLs: URLS that are valid only for a limited time

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the web
- The website url will be something like this:
    - s3-website dash (-) Region ‐ http://bucket-name.s3-website-Region.amazonaws.com
    - s3-website dot (.) Region ‐ http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com
- If we forget to allow public reads in bucket policies, we will get a 403 - Forbidden when accessing the website

## CORS

- An origin is a scheme (protocol), host (domain) and a port
- CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Web browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
- The request wont ne fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the request, using CORS Headers (ex: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Method`)
- If a client does a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers
- We can allow for a specific origin or for `*` (all origins)

## S3 Consistency Model

- S3 provides *read after write* consistency for PUTS of new objects
    - As son as a new object is written, we can retrieve it (PUT 200 => GET 200)
    - This is true, except if we did a GET before to see if the object existed (GET 404 => PUT 200 => GET 404)
- S3 provides *eventual consistency* for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects
    - If we read an object after updating it, we might get a the older version (PUT 200 => PUT 200 => GET 200 (which might return the older version))
    - If we delete an object, we might be able to delete it for a short amount of time (DELETE 200 => GET 200)
- There is no way to request strong consistency for S3!
