# EC2 High Availability and Scalability - Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups

## Scalability and High Availability

- Scalability: an application or system can handle greater loads by adapting
- They are two kinds of scalability:
    - Vertical scalability: we need to increase the size of the instance. Used for non-distributed systems such as databases
    - Horizontal scalability (elasticity): we need to increase the number of instances/systems for the application. Implies having distributed systems, such as modern web applications

## High Availability

- High availability means running an application/system in at least 2 data centers (usually 2 AZs)
- The goal of the high availability is to survive a data center loss
- High availability can be passive (RDS Multi AZ deployment) or active (horizontal scaling)

## Load Balancing Introduction

- Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances)
- Reasons to use a load balancer:
    - Spread the load across multiple downstream instances
    - Expose a single point of access (DNS) to the application
    - Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
    - Do regular health checks to the instances, redirect the traffic in case of failure to healthy instances
    - Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for our website
    - Enforce stickiness with cookies
    - High available across availability zones
    - Separate public traffic from private traffic

## Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- An ELB is a managed load balancer, meaning:
    - AWS guarantees that it will be working
    - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance and high availability
    - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
- It costs less to setup our non-managed load balancer but it will be a lot less effort to use a managed one

## Types of Load Balancers

- AWS offers 3 types of load balancers:
    - Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation)
    - Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation)
    - Network Load Balancer  (v2 - new generation)
- Overall it is recommended to use the newer v2 generation load balancers as they provide more features
- We can set up external or internal load balancers

## Health Checks

- Health Checks are crucial for load balancers
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances, to which traffic is forwarded, are available to reply to requests
- The health check is done on a port and a route (`/health` is common)
- If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is considered to be unhealthy

## Application Load Balancers (v2)

- Application Load Balancers (Layer 7) allow to do:
    - Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
    - Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)
    - Load balancing based on route in URL
    - Load balancing based on hostname in URL
- Basically they are perfect for micro-services and container based applications
- ALB has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port
- Stickiness can be enabled at the target group level
    - Same request goes to the same instance
    - Stickiness is directly generated by the ALB (not the application)
- ALB supports HTTP/HTTPS and WebSockets protocols
- The application servers don't see the IP of the client directly
    - The IP of the client we initiated the request is encoded in the header `X-Forwarded-For`
    - We can also get the Port (`X-Forwarded-Port`) and the protocol (`X- Forwarded-Proto`)

## Network Load Balancers (v2)

- Network Load Balancers (Layer 4) allow to do:
    - Forward TCP and UDP traffic to the instances
    - Handle millions of requests oer second
    - Support for static IP and elastic IP
- NLBs have less latency (~100ms) compared to ALB (~400ms)
- NLBs are mostly used for extreme performance and should not be the default load balancer of choice

## Got to Know

- Classic Load Balancers (CLB) are deprecated, we should use ALB or NLB instead
- CLB and ALB support SSL certificates and provide SSL termination
- All load balancers have health check capability
- ALB can route based on hostname and path
- All of the load balancers have a static host name, we should not resolve the URL to get the IP
- LBs can scale but not instantly -  contact AWS for warm-up
- In case of NLB, we can directly see the requester IP address
- 4xx errors are client induced errors
- 5xx errors are application induced errors
    - LB error 503 means the LB is at capacity or there are no registered targets
- If the LB can not connect ot an application, we should check the security groups

## Load Balancer Stickiness

- It is possible to implement stickiness meaning the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
- Stickiness works for both CLB and ALB
- Stickiness is achieved by setting a cookie on the request. This cookie has an expiration date
- Use case for stickiness: make sure to not use session data
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

## Load Balancer for SysOps

- Application Load Balancer (ALB):
    - Layer 7 (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket)
    - URL based routing (hostname or path)
    - Does not support static IP, but has a fixed DNS
    - Provides SSL termination
- Network Load Balancer (NLB):
    - Layer 4 (TCP)
    - No pre-warming needed
    - I provides a static IP per subnet
    - Does not provide SSL termination (SSL must be enabled by the application itself)
- Fixed IP for ALB: we have to chain an NLB and an ALB the have a static fixed IP address for the ALB

## Load Balancer Pre-Warming

- ELB scales gradually to the actual traffic
- ELB may fail in case of sudden spike of traffic (10x traffic)
- If we expect high traffic, we have to open a support ticket with AWS to pre-warm the ELB. We have to answer the following questions:
    - Duration of traffic
    - Expected request per second
    - Size of a request (in KB)

## Load Balancer Error Codes

- Successful request: 200
- Unsuccessful at client side: 2xx
    - 400: Bad Request
    - 401: Unauthorized
    - 403: Forbidden
    - 460: Client closed connection
    - 463: X-Forwarded-For header with has over 30 IP addresses (similar to malformed request)
- Unsuccessful at server side: 5xx
    - 500: Internal server error, would mean some error happened on the ELB itself
    - 502: Bad Gateway
    - 503: Service Unavailable (server overloaded)
    - 504: Gateway Timeout
    - 561: Unauthorized Request

## SSL for Older Browser

- Common question: how do we support Legacy Browsers that have and old TLS (TLS 1.0)?
- Answer: change the policy to allow for weaker cipher (example: DES-CBC3-SHA for TLS 1.0)

## LB Common Troubleshooting

- We have to check the security groups
- We have check the health checks (maybe some application is down)
- Sticky sessions may bring imbalance on the load balancing side
- For Multi-AZ, we have to make sure cross zone load balancing is enabled
- We should use internal load balancer for private applications that don't need a public access
- We should enable deletion protection for production load balancers
